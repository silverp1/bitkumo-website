We are super excited to announce the official launch of the Bitkumo cloud! Over the last two weeks we have secured infrastructure, flushed out bugs, cleaned up our main website, and worked nonstop to create something that we are proud to share with the world. We are thrilled to be opening our doors to hackers like ourselves who are looking for a no nonsense hosting solution.

We are firm believers in an _a la carte_ pricing model that just doesn't seem to exist in the industry so we've decided to do our very best to make that happen. We've started with decoupling support costs from the pricing of our virtual machines. By doing this, we estimate we can offer services to you at a 20% discount compared to larger providers. We intend to take this further by adding various _a la carte_ priced services in the coming months.

The Bitkumo team has several years of combined experience in Linux, hosting, and servers. We are committed to building a platform that you will love. We have some huge plans for the future of Bitkumo and we are just getting started, stay tuned!
