We are very happy to announce that we have drastically improved the hardware we use to provide Bitkumo services.

We have moved our infrastructure from our previous provider over to OVH and in doing that we have acquired much newer and performant hardware. Our new host specifications are as follows:

* Intel Xeon D-1520
* 64GB ECC DDR4 RAM
* 4x800GB SSDs
* 1 GBps uplink

Effective today, February 5th, 2016 all new machines created on the Bitkumo platform will land on our new SSD backed hardware.

We are particularly proud to say we have managed to acquire this hardware at only a small increase over our previous hardware so *prices for Bitkumo services will remain the same*.

If you are an existing customer please [contact us](mailto:wtf@bitkumo.com) for more information on how you can migrate your existing machine to this new hardware.

Please feel free to [contact us](mailto:social@bitkumo.com) if you have any questions about our new hardware.
